# Password Strength Assessment Tool

## Overview
The Password Strength Assessment Tool is designed to evaluate the strength of user-provided passwords based on various criteria. This tool provides users with immediate feedback, helping them to create more secure passwords that meet modern security standards.

## Features
- **Length Assessment**: Checks if the password meets a minimum length requirement.
- **Character Diversity**:
  - Evaluates the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters.
  - Detects numbers.
  - Identifies special characters.
- **Strength Feedback**:
  - Ranges from "Weak" to "Very Strong" based on password complexity.
  - Provides actionable suggestions for improvement.
- **Real-Time Validation**: Offers instant results as the user types (if integrated into a front-end application).

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Flask (optional, for web-based implementation)
- **Additional Libraries**:
  - `re` for regular expressions
  - `argparse` for CLI implementations (optional)
